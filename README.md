This repo is meant to collect odd thoughts, observations, lessons learned, and stuff that has worked for me.  Some of it will be notes to myself.  Some of it is for sharing with students I mentor.  I hope some of it may be useful to others.

**Likely topics:** Digital Forensics (DFIR), Information Security (InfoSec), GNU/Linux, Trail Mix
